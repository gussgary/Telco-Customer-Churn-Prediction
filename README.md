## Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts customer churn in the telecommunications industry to help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

**Course**: MTDS 5143 Applied Machine Learning  
**Type**: Individual Lab Practical Assessment  
**Dataset**: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Business Question
How can we predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry to improve customer retention strategies and reduce revenue loss?

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Kaggle - IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- **Size**: 7,043 customers with 21 features
- **Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)
- **Features Include**: Demographics, account information, and service usage patterns

## Key Findings
- Overall churn rate: 26.5%
- Month-to-month contracts have highest churn risk
- Electronic check payment method correlates with higher churn
- New customers (tenure < 12 months) are most likely to churn

## Machine Learning Models
Implemented and compared 4 different algorithms:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
